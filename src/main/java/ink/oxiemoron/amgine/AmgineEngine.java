    // lets just go pixelz

    // #1 make an array of arrays

    // eg.

    // {
    // {},
    // ...}

    // #2 populate it with bunch o' ids

    // eg2.

    // {
    // {×××..×}, 10 o' 'em - methane-yl decane-yl (¿ should we dream so largè ?)
    // ...}

    // #3 store alkanes and radicals(alkyls?) as simple instructions to "plot" the groups in the array(notepad.amoled kek)
    //                                   (idk rn, but something like isLong=3 only, lol)

    // And then maybe just write a plotter to go over and be like:
    // ##1 Far right side should be the root (longest chain)
    // ##2 Read the instructions (ye, sure m8) and find a nice and longestE place to plot
    //                                               (a ref to my greatestE in the crypt0 test)
    // ##3 Now turn to the left, do some hocusPokus with the AST and the rForms and the rStructs and the rDash bunch
    //                                                                               (do we even need the Dashez and the Commaz?)
    // ##4 Apply alkyl logic (orientation and ...) while plotting the rest
    // ##5 ??
    // ##6 ♪And that's what it's all about.♫

    // ...and then fileWriter.append() "compile" into a fun one
    // ......might even reconsider going abstract and try other cilley ones

    // I'm not sure for different solutions
    // As I went for the beating around the bushes technique™

    // The only thing i googled about this concrete subject is if it could be done, as i really wanted to do it
    // after seeing an earned stackoverflow brag about a same/similar thing, i went full in,

    // disregarding some other stuff maybe, hah

    // i found the stuff i referenced.
    // liked it.
    // read it.
    // loved it.
    // read it again.
    // hated it.
    // read it again.
    // oh the md is in russian, hahaha
    // Стек-машина

    // I hope some young prankster finds my github in a distant(i'm an optimist, sue me) future
    // And he gets the chills i got way back then, hahah lol = MsgBox...

    // I'm not that good (to give chills i mean, haha)

    // But i'm reflecting™ on what i have seen (and that has given me chills)

    // from typewriters and vbses, to VB5~6 and
    //
    // VB keylogging application that would present itself as a facebook login form
    //
    // If someone enters creds, nice, smtp in the back
    // if not redirect to a free hosted php phishing website (!?!?!?!?!)
    // Again same principle
    // On empty agin redirect to fb
    // using nslookup, haha, shame on you school in a random village over some 10yago....

    // ran many times in dev

    // ran once in prod, worked, nice, i got an email, it's me, nice

    // a white hat (lol, a small one for sure) since days[0]...











    // that i wrote in elementary...

    // and couldn't wrote now if it were to save our lives
















    // ...











    // and then Java and the VM (>> V8 for sure... haha burrrnnn)

    // it was kind of an inspiration..

    // Man, that's cilly (to me at least...)... hahah

    // and fun()

    // still, we shall see shell... i haven't slept in like~36h
    // was coding all night
    // mowed a lawn in like 4 hours, ama
    // returned and Bam!


    // please judge and explain, hahaha
    // for i might be horribly wrong




    // still roping in the basics, but will start/continue with the nature (alt+3) and the /treeeees (iykwim, but u should by now)


    // Btw we plot the basic lego block - methyl as ©.. hahaha
    // we can ignore(?) the Hs for noe, as you can just add the bonds up to four for Cs total, basically

    // and we are trying the cilly first

    // and then we store just (name, N times ©) as the alkane/alkyl


    // When we bridge the two* we have so far we will consider different compilers and ideas and alfreds and alkenes and alkynes
