_A Bourne Again incentive to fight against inertia_

aka

_Yet another proof of concept I have no business starting_

---------------------------

_**Overview:**_

_So.. I am at another iteration of Bjarne's books. I always liked his method of presenting and I felt like I left all that business unfinished.
Due to moving often + not knowing better and backup stuff, most of the things I wrote are lost in the void._

_After stumbling upon some of the ridiculous C++ files I managed to save/salvage, I went through all 5 stages of grief and "crafted" a plan._


_I want to play around with tokens, lexers, parsers and the bunch._

_I also noticed that half of my projects are shady math solutions. Which is fine, but I feel like I owe something to my "alma mater", Chemistry._

_One of my fondest memories in all of the Chemistry is IUPAC nomenclature/naming conventions. My idea is that I could play with that and I choose Java for many reasons, sue me._

_I'm keeping it "simple", and look forward to all of the OOPsies I make along the way._

_Due to limited time and a problem with re-learning things and filling some gaps, this might be a long ride, but at least this time I'll end up with some files (that make sense?)_


_My [ozone](https://www.plaintech.ink/ozone) [project](https://www.github.com/kaysersoze42/ozone) is an answer to a bad (by my standards!) Flask + JavaScript, [SaveTheOzone project](https://www.github.com/kaysersoze42/savetheozone). I realized what have I [done](https://github.com/KayserSoze42/extend.io/tree/main/src/neveroddoreven/theOzone) <sup>[again](https://github.com/KayserSoze42/extend.io/blob/main/src/Cpp/regex/ReVec.cpp)</sup>, endured some [PTSD++](https://github.com/KayserSoze42/extend.io/tree/main/src/root/appDruid) flashbacks, and here we are._

_Hopefuly the things I learn here can apply to [TOMTQ project](https://www.github.com/kaysersoze42/tomtq), even though the parsing there isn't really the main attraction._

_Then again, resistance might be futile._
